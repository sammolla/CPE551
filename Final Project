# GitHub API Project CPE551

# This program asks for the user to input a GitHub user and it will print their owned repositories and the number of commits for those repositories
 
# Important Note: This is hitting the GitHub API, if you run the program too many times they will lock you out. Very frustrating to work on :(
 
# Imports from external librares
import requests
import json
 
# This line asks the user top input a GitHub user they want to search for
searchingUser = input("Please enter a valid GitHub user that you would like to search for: ")
 
# This is to define my function. We need an input from the user to make this function work
def getGitHub(userInput):
 
# This is where I connect to the GitHUb API and store the information in a txt format in a json file
   
    url = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/"+userInput+"/repos")
   
    x = json.loads(url.text)
 
# This is where I am setting up a dictionary for the information from the user to be stored
    repos = []
 
    i = 0
 
    while i < len(x):
 
        repos.append(x[i]['name'])
 
        i = i + 1
 
# This is where I am actually getting and filling the information in about the user
    for repository in repos:
       
        commits = requests.get("https://api.github.com/repos/" + userInput + "/" + repository + "/commits")
       
        y = json.loads(commits.text)
       
        print('Repo: ' + repository + ' - Number of commits: ' + str(len(y)))  
 
getGitHub(searchingUser)
